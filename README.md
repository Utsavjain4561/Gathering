# Cluster
It is an android application based on the theme of gathering. Event organizers have a responsibility to ensure that health and safety risks are properly managed for all attendees, including staff, contractors, volunteers and members of the public. This might not seem like a challenge when walking around your empty venue, but as soon as a crowd starts forming it doesnâ€™t take much for minor or major injuries to occur.

# Problems our app focuses to solve :
- Garbage is produced in large amounts in public gatherings which leads to several health issues.
- Receiving medical attention at the right time in case of an emergency.
- Stampedes are frequent in India due to poor crowd management. These stampedes are the reason behind many deaths in our country.

# How our app focuses to solve the above problems :
- Efficient garbage management by marking the location of garbage on map which is later collected by the cleanliness volunteers.
- Fast medical attention by marking the location of medical emergency on map so that help reaches quickly.
- Marking exit locations on map so that people can rush out safely and quickly in case of an emergency.
